# 🃏 Solitaire – Console-Based Card Game

Completed this project as part of my **Data Structures & Algorithms** course in the **3rd semester**.  
We developed the classic game of **Solitaire** using core data structures and object-oriented programming principles in C++.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📂 **Doubly Linked Lists**  
  Used to represent the tableau columns for efficient card movement in both directions.

- 🧭 **Iterators**  
  Implemented for traversal and manipulation of linked lists.

- 📦 **Stacks**  
  Applied for managing the stockpile, wastepile, foundations, and the **undo** feature.

- 💻 **Command-Line Interface**  
  Interactive console-based gameplay with user input parsing and validation.

- 🧠 **Object-Oriented Design**  
  Modular code with proper class structures and efficient memory management.
